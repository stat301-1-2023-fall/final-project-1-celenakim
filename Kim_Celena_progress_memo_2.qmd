## Joining Datasets
The data used in this project is called [Hollywood Hits and Flops (2007 - 2023)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sujaykapadnis/hollywood-hits-and-flops-2007-2023/) found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). There are 16 different csv files containing movie data for each year from 2007-2023, so joining data sets was necessary. However, there were some discrepancies between the data sets, so some preliminary cleaning was needed. First, the data sets had diferent numbers of columns, with the years 2011-2022 having one or two extra variables: `film list` and/or `financial source`. These variables were not necessary for my analysis, so I used for loops to remove those variables from those data sets, and ended up with 33 variables in all 16 files. Next, I noticed that there were some slight differences in column names, such as "Genres" vs. "Genres", so I ensured that all variable names across the data sets were uniform using another for loop. After these changes, all 16 files matched in column number and variable name, so I was then able to use rbind() combine all of them into one data set: "movie_data".


## Data Cleaning
After my files were condensed into one main data set, I did a bit more data set cleaning. First, the variable names were not in snake case form, so I fixed that using the clean_names() function. Next, I noticed that there were more unnecessary variables-- `link`, which provided an Amazon link to the movie, and `None`, which just had NAs in every observation-- so I decided to remove them from the data set as well. Third, after glimpsing my data, I noticed that variables such as `critic ratings` and `domestic gross earnings` were character type variables rather than integers, so I converted those variables into integers using as.integer() so I would be able to conduct numerical analyses. Next, I noticed that there were NAs for some movies' `genre` variable, even though they had a value in `primary genre`, so I made an ifelse statement that set a movie's NA in `genre` to its `primary genre`, if the primary genre was present. And finally, in order to be able to conduct analyses with the `oscar_winners` variable, I changed it's type to be a boolean using an ifelse statement. If a movie one an Oscar, the variable's observation would read TRUE, and if it did not win an Oscar, it would be FALSE.

## Univariate Analyses

### What variables change over the years? 
## Exploration 1: How do the overall average opening weekend earnings change over the years from 2007-2022?
![](figures/avg_opening_wknd_earnings_yearly_table.png)
![](figures/avg_opening_wknd_earnings_yearly.png)
These visualizations represent the change in the mean opening weekend earnings (in millions) for Hollywood movies from 2007-2022. As can be seen by the graph, the years with the most successful opening weekends in terms of highest mean earnings are the years 2012 and 2014, closely tied with an average earning of 27 million dollars. The lowest point on the graph corresponds to 2020, with that year earning the least during opening weekend: 8 million dollars. This data definitely reflects the times/economy of the country during this year, as 2020 was the year that America was under quarantine and movie theaters were shut down, so they earned significantly less money than as compared to previous years.

## Exploration 2: How do the overall average rotten tomato critic ratings change over the years from 2007-2022?
![](figures/yearly_rt_critic_rating_plot.png)
This graph represents the change in the average Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings for Hollywood movies for each year from 2007-2022. Overall, it seems that the average critic ratings have increased significantly over the years, with about a 30% increase in ratings from 2007 to 2022.

## Exploration 3: How do the overall average metacritic critic ratings change over the years from 2007-2022?
![](figures/yearly_mc_critic_rating_plot.png)
This graph represents the change in the average Metacritic critic ratings for Hollywood movies for each year from 2007-2022. Like the previous Rotten Tomatoes critic rating plot, this data also seems to have followed the trend of critic ratings increasing over the years, but this increase is less dramatic with it being only 20%. Also, both the Rotten Tomatoes critic and Metacritic rating plots seem to follow similar trends of increase, decrease, and peaks, such as ratings increasing significantly from 2009-2012, and dropping significantly from 2019-2020.


## Multivariate Analyses

### What variables affect a movie's opening weekend earnings or Oscar win count?
### Exploration 1: Which genre has the highest mean opening weekend earning? 
![](figures/genre_opening_success_mean.png)
As shown in the table, the "sci-fi & fantasy" genre combination had the most success in terms of highest opening weekend earnings, with about 248 million dollars in earnings.

### Exploration 2: Which genre has the highest Oscar wins?
![](figures/genre_oscar_counts_table.png)
In terms of Oscar win success, the "biography & history" genre was the most successful as this genre combination earned the most amount of Oscars: 4.

### Exploration 3: Which script type has the highest mean opening weekend earning? 
![](figures/script_type_opening_success_table.png)
The script type combination that had the most successful opening weekend is "sequel & adaptation", with a mean opening weekend earning of about 84 million


### Exploration 4: Which script type has the highest Oscar wins?
![](figures/script_type_oscar_counts_table.png)
The script type that earned the most Oscars is "original screenplay", with 28 Oscar wins.

### Exploration 5: Do movies that have won Oscars have better Rotten Tomatoes critic ratings?
![](figures/rt_rating_oscar_table.png)
The table shows that movies that have won an Oscar have a much higher average Rotten Tomatoes critic rating than those who have not won an Oscar (89 vs. 54).

### Exploration 6: How do the different critic ratings correlate with opening weekend success?
![](figures/rt_critic_success_cor_plot.png)
![](figures/rt_audience_success_cor_plot.png)
![](figures/mc_critic_success_cor_plot.png)
![](figures/mc_audience_success_cor_plot.png)
Comparing the line of best fits between the four graphs, the "Rotten Tomatoes Audience Rating" has the steepest line of best fit, and thus the highest positive correlation with "Opening Weekened Earnings (millions)". The relationship is strongest between these two variables.


### Exploration 7: Which distributor has the most Oscar wins?

### Exploration 8: Which distributor has the highest IMDb rating?


## Summary of Findings
Students should summarize their progress, where they are at, and what their next steps will be. Self assessment of progress would also be appropriate. When thinking or describing next steps students should share any guiding curiosities or research questions they plan to explore.
